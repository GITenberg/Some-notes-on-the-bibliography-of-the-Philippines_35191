<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">So many inquiries have been made in the Free
Library of Philadelphia for information concerning the history and
literature of the Philippines, that an earnest effort was made some
time ago to gather together books bearing on these subjects. The fact
that a short catalogue of Philippine literature, prepared by the
bibliographer, W. E. Retana, comprises as many as three thousand
separate works, is a matter known to comparatively few persons, and it
was therefore with considerable interest that the Philobiblon Club of
Philadelphia obtained the promise of the Rev. Thomas Cooke Middleton
that he would read a paper upon the bibliography of the Philippines
before the Club. This Bulletin is a copy of that paper, as read in
substance, and it would have been published several months since but
for the unfortunate loss of the manuscript in the office of the
newspaper to which the author had confided it. In answer to the urgent
requests of the members of the Philobiblon Club, Father Middleton very
kindly re-wrote it and consented that it should be printed by the Free
Library of Philadelphia for the use of the students and patrons of the
Library. An evil fate, however, seemed to pursue the manuscript, and
within four days after it had been completed for the second time it
perished in the great fire which destroyed the printing house of J. B.
Lippincott Co. Once more the author took courage, and again wrote out
the paper, and these facts are recorded both as a matter of interest,
and to explain why this Bulletin has been so long delayed.</p>
<p>A collection of books on the subject of the Philippines is being
gradually accumulated, and it seems desirable both to furnish the
readers in the Library with information upon the subject, and also to
take an opportunity to counteract the popular misapprehension as to
what has been done by the residents of the Philippines in the way of
literature.</p>
<p>Since the collection of works on this subject was commenced the Free
Library has prepared and mimeographed from time to time for the use of
its readers &ldquo;Finding Lists&rdquo; of the books on the shelves
relating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>to the Philippine Islands. The latest of these
lists, prepared May 4, 1900, shows that fifty-four volumes have been
collected and also gives references to nearly six hundred magazine
articles in the Library.</p>
<p>Possibly one of the most interesting books received in the Library
is the <i lang="es">Flora de Filipinas</i>, consisting of four folio
volumes of text (printed in Spanish and Latin on the same page) and two
of colored lithographed plates. It was published at Manila
1877&ndash;1883 for the friars of St. Augustine under the direction of
H. Ex. the late Sebastiano Vidal y Soler, assisted scientifically by
the able botanists, the Rev. Fathers Fr. Andres Naves and Fr. Celestino
Fern&aacute;ndez Villar, both of the Augustinian order of friars. It
was composed from manuscripts of the late Father Blanco of the same
order. The plates were drawn and colored from nature by native artists,
and sent to Barcelona where they were lithographed, and after six
hundred copies were printed off, the stones were destroyed. As will be
noticed, in many cases the specimens are given both in fruit and
flower, necessitating in most instances a gathering of the specimens at
distinct seasons of the year.</p>
<p>The book was published as a serial work, two or three parts with
four plates each (with corresponding descriptions) appearing monthly.
There were several stoppages during the printing of the work, caused by
a large fire at one time and an earthquake at another, from both of
which the printing establishment at which the book was being published
suffered. In this manner the time occupied in the publication was
prolonged.</p>
<p>The original editor was Sr. Domingo Vidal, who unfortunately, after
only two or three parts of the work had been given out, was obliged to
leave the Islands on account of poor health. Several months later he
died and his brother, who had assumed the editorship, upon his
departure from Manila, continued the work until it was finished.</p>
<p>The Trustees of the Free Library of Philadelphia desire to express
their thanks to the Rev. Dr. Middleton for the contribution to
bibliography which follows. A short <a href="#index">index</a> has been
added, which it is believed will fit the paper for general use. Many
thanks are due to Mr. John Ashhurst for his assistance in this tedious
part of the Bulletin.</p>

<p class="firstpar">The following pages, embodying a survey (on a broad
scale) of the chief characteristics of Philippine intellectual energy,
in its various lines of art, science, letters, seem an objective worthy
of the American scholar, who, to his own large group of aboriginal
tongues at home, has now to add to his field of study a similarly
far-reaching family of the many-toned dialects of
Malaysia,&mdash;twenty-seven idioms at least in number,&mdash;according
to Retana&rsquo;s tabulation, whereof I give a list drawn from his
latest bibliography of the Philippines,<a class="noteref" id=

enumerating the various works published in the several dialects in use

<p>This bibliography, which we rightly may term wealthy in its two
thousand six hundred and ninety-seven titles<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e426src" href="#xd20e426" name="xd20e426src">2</a> of numbered
pieces of literature, besides being based largely on the author&rsquo;s
own choice collection of Philippina, cites also fourteen other
bibliographies of that archipelago.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e441src"
href="#xd20e441" name="xd20e441src">3</a></p>
<p>In his own list of Philippine languages, or branch-tongues, of this
quarter of Malaysia, in all (as he gives them) thirty-seven in number,
some are mentioned, that, except in a broad sense, will not easily be
recognized as members of the distinctively Philippine family; such as
Sanscrit, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Nahuatl of Central America,
along with Kanaka or Ponap&eacute;,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e448src"
href="#xd20e448" name="xd20e448src">4</a> Chamorro and Malgacho, or
Malagasy, as we more familiarly style it, three dialects spoken in
lands outside of the Philippine zone,&mdash;of Yap, or Guap, in the
eastern Carolines, the Marianas, or Ladrones, and Madagascar
respectively.</p>
<p>Wherefore, subtracting these nine foreign localized idiom-groups
along with Malay (presumably ancestral tongue of the Philippines, as of
other western Polynesian languages), though herein many scholars hold
that Aeta, or Papuan, is mother, I have reduced the idioms peculiar (in
large measure) to that archipelago itself to the number (given
ahead)&mdash;twenty-seven.</p>
<p>On this question of race and idiom unity Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, whom
I cite frequently in this sketch, says that the vocabularies of New
Zealand, New Holland, New Guinea, and part of New Hebrides (gathered by
Captain Cook) were all easily understood by him through his familiarity
with Philippine dialects; that, moreover, from his knowledge of the
racial and linguistic characteristics of nearly all South Sea
islanders, especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>of the peoples from Madagascar to Easter
Island, including (he distinctly declares) the natives of the Friendly,
or Society Isles, of the Sandwich and Marquesas groups, he was of
opinion that aboriginal stock of all, in tongue and blood, including
even the natives of Central America, was Aeta, or Papuan, otherwise
styled (in the Philippines) Negrito.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e462src"
href="#xd20e462" name="xd20e462src">5</a> As far back as the early part
of the seventeenth century this same question of race and language
identity of the Philippine people was treated by the Jesuit Chirino, of
whom we shall say more further on; then later by another Jesuit
scholar, at one time provincial superior of his society in the
Philippines, Francisco Col&iacute;n, in his <i lang="es">Lavor
evangelica</i>, (Madrid, 1663); and by Lorenzo Herv&aacute;s y Panduro,
a linguist of deserved eminence in the world of letters, formerly
Jesuit. See his <i lang="es">Catalogo</i> (in six quarto vols., Madrid,
1800&ndash;1805), and you will learn very much about many strange
things, among others, that the theory maintained by the English
Wallace, the German Blumentritt, and later ethnologists, as to the
identity of these Polynesians&mdash;Papuans and Malays&mdash;perhaps
the only one now held by scholars&mdash;is venerably old, by two
centuries and more. But really, in view of the apparently
irreconcilable opinions of linguists on this topic, further discussion
of it seems unprofitable.</p>
<p>As concerns the Philippines themselves, neither have their isles all
been numbered, nor their sub-races and branch-idioms classified, except
in what we may style a generic scheme.</p>
<p>Back now to our bibliographer. No study in mere humanities, it
seems, could be more fascinating to your all-round scholar, and more
fruitful especially to anthropologist, than with the guidance of Retana
and other like gifted students of Philippina, to enlarge somewhat on
this bibliographical theme, since in letters chiefly do men of upright
mind find equipment for meditation of spirit, main source of all
healthful, sober, intellectual recreation and work.</p>
<p>Our list of Philippina, as you will notice, although given merely in
outline, embraces in its sweep across the literary horizon of that
quarter of Malaysia many works of recognized merit in the several lines
of intellectual energy&mdash;of history, arch&aelig;ology, ethnology,
philology and natural philosophy; books, all of them, which, if
perchance not masterpieces according to the higher standard of
Caucasian scholarship, will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>yet be acknowledged of much interest,
nay, of great value in the inspiration and development of scientific
thought.</p>
<p>In this bibliographical skeleton, then, I shall point out those
sources of information anent the Philippine Islands, wherein the
scholar can best find a general description or history of them, the
most trustworthy works on their very varied and multiform language, as
well as other topics cognate with these. Hence these sub-sections into
which my paper is split: (1) <a href="#ch1">Works of General
Information</a>; (2) <a href="#ch2">Authorities on Philippine
Dialects</a>; (3) <a href="#ch3">Some Literary Curios among
Philippina</a>; (4) <a href="#ch4">Philippine Presses</a>; (5) <a href=
"#ch5">Introduction of Printing into the Philippines</a>.</p>
<p>First, I name the chief works of reference,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e501src" href="#xd20e501" name="xd20e501src">6</a> of the highest,
most authoritative character, bearing on the distinctive peculiarities
of the Philippines,&mdash;works that will be recognized as serviceable
to the general reader and scholar, to him that seeks to learn of the
history of that archipelago, of its antiquities, and characteristics of
the many tribes that people it,&mdash;of their customs, religious
beliefs, superstitions and rites; of the fauna, flora, geology of those
islands; in brief, of whatever refers to this part of Malaysia. For no
matter how much the Malay,&mdash;Javan, Bornese, Sumatran, as well as
Philippinian&mdash;has been civilized&mdash;Christianized, so far (as
must be conceded) he has not become Caucasian in mind, nor will, nor
spirit. He remains as he was, (nor any wonder), wholly Asiatic. Albeit,
for three centuries and upwards, taught, ruled, elevated (at times,
too, disedified) by white men, the Malay, or brown man, is not, perhaps
never will be, employed by Europeans, save in very limited sphere, in
wholly subordinate trusts, whether in commerce, trade, or whatsoever
other field of human activity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">But let us on to our list of works of general
reading. Sifting the treasure-stores of authorities named in Retana and
others, I find the following books of most value and service, whereof,
though some few among them, and for that matter the highest in their
respective classes, are no longer in print, yet these very
masterpieces, if not obtainable by purchase, like many another
priceless blessing, still are worth knowing by title to book-lover and
scholar, who, if perchance he cannot have these repertories of human
lore on his shelves, will know at least by what title to seek them on
others.</p>
<p>Of the Philippines and their neighboring archipelagos these works
rank of the highest worth:</p>
<p>The history of Mindanao, Jolo, and their adjacent islands (Madrid,
1667), written by the Jesuit, Francisco Comb&eacute;s&mdash;the most
ancient detailed account of that region of Polynesia, known as the
Archipelago <i lang="es">del Sur</i>, and invaluable beyond other
guides to the ethnologist especially.</p>
<p>Then an account of the establishment of Christianity in the Marianas
Islands (Madrid, 1670?) similarly the oldest and at the same time most
reliable history of these Ladrones, or robber, islands, so styled by
early Spanish voyagers because of the thievish proclivities of the
natives, every one of them in theory and practice an annexationist and
protectionist to the back-bone, till the Jesuit missionary and scholar,
Diego Luis de Sanvitores, author of this history, rechristened them
Marianas, in honor (according to some chroniclers) of Do&ntilde;a
Mariana of Austria, Queen of Spain, in loving and tenderest-hearted
homage (according to others) of the Blessed Virgin, whose rosary that
savant was wont to recite every day.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e522src"
href="#xd20e522" name="xd20e522src">1</a></p>
<p>Then the story of the various religious missions in the Philippines
entrusted to members of his Society by another Jesuit, Pedro Murillo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>Velarde (Manila, 1749), a rare and valuable work,
whereof an accompanying chart, drawn in 1734, should, strictly
speaking, be styled the earliest detailed topographical map of the
Philippines. From the pen of the same scholar issued, too, an
historical geography of that archipelago (Madrid, 1752), of much worth,
the same as his chart, for its scientific details&mdash;albeit little
known, it seems, to Philippinologists.</p>
<p>Then we have the rare and deeply interesting history (Madrid, 1756)
of some tribes in Luzon, hardest to convert&mdash;the Igorrotes,
Tinguianes, Apayaos and Adanes, four races of Indians in the
hill-country of Ilocos and Pangasin&aacute;n, in spiritual charge of
the Augustinians, a member of which brotherhood, Manuel Carillo, is the
author.</p>
<p>Another book, that because of its manifold literary merit, of
historical accuracy and statistical detail, is styled by Retana
&ldquo;an historical work <i lang="la">par excellence</i>,&rdquo; is
the general history of the Philippines (Sampaloc, 1788&ndash;1792), by
the Recoleto missionary, Juan de la Concepci&oacute;n, copious source
of varied and valuable information, wherein&mdash;albeit somewhat
prolix in style, at times, too, rather digressive&mdash;the author may
fairly be said to be without rival.</p>
<p>Then comes the descriptive and historical account of the Marianas
Islands (Madrid, 1875), by Felipe La Corte y Ruano Calder&oacute;n, the
best work on that little-known archipelago, and a rich source of
general information anent these Malaysian islands.</p>
<p>On the botany of the Philippines, a monumental work of the highest
character is the Philippine <i>Flora</i> (classified according to the
sexual system of Linn&aelig;us), by the Augustinian, Manuel Blanco,
printed at Manila, first in 1837, again in 1845, and finally
republished a third time in 1877&ndash;1883, in superb style, in four
folio volumes of text in Spanish and Latin, embellished with two
volumes of colored lithographed plates descriptive of the plants,
flowers and fruits of those islands. One of the co-laborers on the
third edition of this <i>Flora</i> was Ignacio Mercado, a Philippine
botanist himself, and professed member of the Augustinian
brotherhood.</p>
<p>The same Father Blanco also translated into Tagal the French
physician Tissot&rsquo;s work on medicine, enriched with his own
life-long observations on Philippine plant-lore.</p>
<p>Along with Blanco&rsquo;s <i>Flora</i> should be named the catalogue
of fauna of the Philippines (Manila, 1895&ndash;1896), by the Dominican
zoologist, Casto de Elera, an expert in that line of biological
science,&mdash;a work in folio (in three volumes) of two thousand three
hundred pages and upwards, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>termed by Retana not only a
monumental work&mdash;easily to be believed&mdash;but one unique of its
character.</p>
<p>The geology of the islands (Madrid, 1840?), treated by Isidro Sainz
de Baranda, government inspector of mines, besides being well worth
reading, is the earliest study on this topic made on strictly
scientific lines.</p>
<p>Two works, sole representatives of their kind, are named by Retana
as of singular value to the physician not only, but to ethnologist and
scholar especially,&mdash;one the <i lang="es">Embriologia Sagrada</i>
(Manila, 1856), by the Recoleto missionary Gregorio Sanz, written in
aid of his fellow caretakers of souls, whose services in behalf of
suffering humanity in out-of-the-way districts were often called upon
by the natives, whose practice of the curing art, based on their own
traditional formulas, especially in cases of child-bearing, was,
despite the efforts of the missionary to uproot their unnatural and
utterly heathen disregard for human life, attended too often with
destruction of progeny and mother.</p>
<p>The other repository of singular and very curious information is a
treatise in Visaya-Cebuano and Spanish by another Recoleto evangelist,
Manuel Vilches (Manila, 1877), written similarly in benefit of Indian
sick, the Manual, that is, of the Visaya Physician, or native
doctor&mdash;<i lang="es">mediquillo</i>, as in the Philippines these
votaries of Hippocrates are styled, a work praised by Retana as replete
with Indian plant-lore.</p>
<p>The richest and most valuable collection of statistics relating to
the Philippines, so at least acknowledged by experts, more reliable too
than the Spanish government&rsquo;s own work, is the <i lang=
"es">Estado general</i> of all the <i lang=
"es">pueblos</i>&mdash;Christianized settlements&mdash;in the islands,
drawn up by the Dominican archbishop of Manila, Pedro Payo (Manila,
1886), whereof the data were gathered by his vicars-forane and
parochial-cures throughout the archipelago. While the most artistic map
of Luzon, so styled by Retana, is the chart of that island (Madrid,
1883), published in four sheets by Enrique D&rsquo;Almonte y
Muriel.</p>
<p>With mention of two other authors I close this section of
Philippina,&mdash;one the history of the islands, or rather a detailed
account of his travels therein, by the Augustinian scholar and voyager
Joaqu&iacute;n Mart&iacute;nez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (Sampaloc,
1803), a work known by its Spanish title as <i lang="es">Estadismo de
las Filipinas o mis viajes</i>, which, translated into English by John
Maver, was published in London in 1814; and lately edited by Retana
himself at Madrid in 1893.</p>
<p>As will be easily apparent to even the most cursory reader,
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>travels, critical throughout in
spirit, display on well nigh every page the results of keen observation
of affairs during his wanderings, combined moreover with sober
reflections on the character and condition of the various races of
people of the chief Philippine islands.</p>
<p>In acknowledgment of its scientific worth, Retana has enriched
Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s history (in the edition just noted) with
twelve scholarly appendices replete with copious erudition, among other
topics on the ethnography and geography of the islands; on animals,
plants, and minerals. In these appendices, too, will be found copious
bibliographies on special topics, as trade, commerce, the <i lang=
"es">n&atilde;o de Acapulco</i>, taxation, finance, and the like.</p>
<p>And,&mdash;I feel that attention shall be called thereto, first
because the subject itself is deeply interesting to lovers especially
of folk-lore, then again, because commonly much misunderstood,&mdash;in
one of his appendices to Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (ii *66&ndash;*83),
Retana has reproduced some twenty-five pages of a Pangasin&aacute;n
Charm Book, covered with strange words&mdash;jumbles, most of them, of
mutilated Church Latin, with crosses and queer-looking symbols. This
charm-book in MS. (as are all its fellows), whereof copies without
count are circulated among the lowest, most superstitious classes of
islanders&mdash;Indians and <i lang="es">meztizos</i>, that is,
Spaniard, or Chinese, mixed with native,&mdash;is wont to be worn
around the neck, in the disguise of a Catholic scapular, as safeguard
to the wearer against perils of any kind, chiefly the knife, or bullet,
of his enemy. Again,&mdash;I am quoting Retana, who gives his own
personal experiences in Luzon,&mdash;so jealously and closely (he says)
do these Indian charm-bearers guard their secret heathenish practice
from their missionaries, who, for ages, albeit not always with good
result, have been striving to detach their wards from such
superstitious usages, that the same scholar and curio-hunter, despite
his keenest research in Luzon, has never been able to catch even a
glimpse but of three of these pagan scapularies, the ones shown to him
by a Dominican missionary, Father Casimiro Lafuente, for many years
cure at the <i lang="es">pueblo</i> of Santa Barbara, in
Pangasin&aacute;n, now (1893) a member of the house of his brotherhood
at Avila, in Spain. Moreover, it appears, from the same Retana, that
Father Lafuente, so many years resident in the islands, had never
succeeded in unearthing other scapularies than these self-same
three.</p>
<p>Many other forms of heathenism, some of them not even yet wholly
banned from the Philippines, the reader will find described in another
of Retana&rsquo;s works&mdash;<i lang="es">de Aniter&iacute;as</i>
(Madrid, 1894). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga also tells all worth knowing of the abominable
rites practised among Luzonians,&mdash;of their Nonos, Duendes, the
Pag-Papasipin, Tigbalag, Patianac, Bongsol, and Bilao. Much of what he
says regarding the attachment of these peoples to unclean and impious
ceremonies he has gathered from that rarest of books&mdash;one copy
only believed to be extant, at the colonial museum of the Augustinians
at Valladolid (in Spain), the <i lang="es">Pr&aacute;ctica</i> (Manila,
1731), of Father Tom&aacute;s Ortiz, one-time missionary of that
brotherhood in China, then for thirty years resident in Luzon, where he
died in 1742.</p>
<p>Better, however, consult Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga himself,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e615src" href="#xd20e615" name="xd20e615src">2</a>
and the notes thereon by Retana, who singularly has failed to insert
Ortiz&rsquo; <i lang="es">Pr&aacute;ctica</i> in his <i lang=
"es">Biblioteca</i>, and you will find much of interest;&mdash;among
other things about tattooing, common practice at one time among all
Polynesians, the same as among our own aborigines, until taught more
refined ways by Christian missionaries; and about wakes
too,&mdash;solemn ceremonials of grief, with banquetting and
chants&mdash;on the occasion of the death of kindred.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e626src" href="#xd20e626" name="xd20e626src">3</a></p>
<p>Anent these and similar breaches of the Divine commands against
Satanism, it is surprising (I would observe) to reflect how many forms
of spirit and idol-worship<a class="noteref" id="xd20e634src" href=
"#xd20e634" name="xd20e634src">4</a> are (to their degradation be it
said) common with Malaysian and Caucasian. (See in our own periodicals,
published presumably by bright-minded, clean-souled Christian
philosophers, yes, see in these oracles of our fireside, advertisements
of magicians, diviners, fortune-tellers, charm-workers, not to speak of
other law breakers, whose mere self-interest seems to have dulled all
true intellective sense.)</p>
<p>The last authority on general topics I name here as invaluable as
well as deeply interesting to the scholar is the Encyclopedia (in two
volumes) of the Augustinian travelers, Manuel Buzeta and Felipe Bravo
(Madrid, 1851)&mdash;a work replete with most varied information along
with statistics, now, of course, out of date, on the ethnology,
geography, topography, dialects, customs and rites of the aborigines in
the Philippine archipelago.</p>
<p>Barring, as is only fair, any eulogy on the antiquated features of
this Encyclopedia, which yet will be recognized of much service to the
historian, the writer himself, who herein is supported among others by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Retana, would style this monument of varied
scholarship and research a masterpiece of all-round learning; within
its lines an indispensable guide to every Philippinologist.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the books most trustworthy and serviceable in their
respective fields of history, antiquities, ethnology, and other
sciences relating to Philippina.</p>
<p>Before leaving this subject to dwell on Philippinian linguistics, I
venture a brief digression on a class of works of general historic
character&mdash;repertories of all ethnic science, little known,
however, albeit to their serious disadvantage, to most students, and
prized only by your true-hearted book-lover, who has sense to value
what he reads for its own worth mainly, not because stamped with
popular approval.</p>
<p>These are annals of the religious brotherhoods in the East, to be
recognized in Retana and other catalogues under the various titles of
chronicles&mdash;sometimes as <i lang="es">Conquistas</i>, a by no
means unfamiliar term&mdash;stories, that is, of the conquest of
heathendom, woven oftentimes, no doubt, as recreation by the missionary
amid his cares; sometimes as relief from thoughts of his far-away
native land&mdash;journals, as it were, drawn up by the wanderer, who,
besides being traveler, usually was a more or less keen-eyed observer,
at home wherever Providence sent him; where, too, he studied (for
self-interest was also at stake) whatever regarded the natives in his
care&mdash;the lands they dwelt in, the skies above them, the waters
around them.</p>
<p>Scholars such as these on life-long service in their foreign homes
were wont to make themselves conversant with every characteristic of
the natives&mdash;with the language first of all, then the legends,
poetry, chants; with the traditions and customs of the people, the
industries and sports of their dusky-hued friends and brothers.</p>
<p>As a rule, these plain, simply-told recitals of matters of fact,
chronicle among other curios of literature, all kinds of even the most
out-of-the-way learning anent the races of men; of plants and animals,
of the various oftentimes most singular phenomena of air, earth, and
water&mdash;subjects, all of them, of eagerest quest on the part of
scientist, ethnologist, linguist, philosopher, naturalist.</p>
<p>These stories, albeit at times verbose, at others digressive, will
be acknowledged by the honest-minded critic as rich, indeed, in
many-sided lore, enough to repay amply whatever time or trouble you
have spent in their reading.</p>
<p>With the exception of one collection of missionary annals&mdash;the
Relations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>of the Jesuits in North America; now being edited
by Reuben Gold Thwaites, Secretary of the State Historical Society of
Wisconsin&mdash;I know of no exact counterpart in the field of English
literature to these delightful narratives of old-time missionary
travelers, Maver&rsquo;s translation of Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s
<i lang="es">Estadismo</i>, in 1814, being not only out of print, but I
suppose unpurchasable.</p>
<p>With the aid of such monuments as these&mdash;all original records
of old-time <i lang="es">conquistadores</i> and their
fellow-missionaries in the Americas, it has resulted (to the delight
and blessing of students) that the cyclopedias of Americana (thirty
nine volumes of them), wherein you will find enshrined whatever is
worthy of preservation in the various chequered cycles of aboriginal
and Spanish polity and art, massed together by the Western historian
Bancroft, are veritably invaluable to the antiquarian, besides being
wholesome and refreshing food for men of intellective genius, as
therein, along with abundant matter for romance and epic, you will see
unraveled and laid bare many a drama of life. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">Now a few words anent the chief authorities on
Philippine linguistics&mdash;treatises, namely, bearing on the various
dialects employed in that archipelago, twenty-seven in number, as
observed ahead, all, however, akin in their common stock&mdash;Malay,
of which these idioms, or <i lang="fr">patois</i>, are daughters, yet
with countless, sharply-marked differences between one another.</p>
<p>A working knowledge of the many fashions of speech so much needed as
obvious, nay, indispensable to traveler or missionary, will be gained
most quickly and thoroughly, it should be premised, from books of
two-fold character,&mdash;(1) namely, from grammars and dictionaries of
the several idioms, based on scientific rules of philology; then (2)
from devotional works&mdash;books of Christian piety, very numerous in
the Philippines, as are religious manuals, prayer-, sermon-, and
confession-books, whereof titles abound in Retana, all pretty much from
the busy pen of missionaries themselves, to whose zeal and ability in
the instruction of their brown and black many-tongued wards is due
largely, nay, wholly, whatever of humanizing, Christian character is
found in Malaysia, as in fact is true also in other countries now
civilized and enlightened, albeit once barbarian.</p>
<p>In his latest bibliography,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e686src" href=
"#xd20e686" name="xd20e686src">1</a> where the number of published
works in each of the twenty-seven dialects of the Philippines is set
down by Retana, you will observe from a study of his lists, that though
in many dialects there are no grammars so entitled, or other scientific
aids to learning a given idiom, yet there are many works of religious
cast printed therein,&mdash;hand-books of practical religion, which you
will find useful beyond measure to linguists. Since from these
prayer-books, wherein are set down plainly the simplest and commonest
rules of Christian ethical conduct, you can easily gather a working
knowledge <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>of the language itself, as the missionary who
composed them was careful to put matters of every-day interest in the
plain, every-day speech of the islanders. Before closing this brief
digression on manuals of piety, I must observe what will prove very
useful, I judge, to the scholar, that with works of the first class, as
grammars and dictionaries, is to be associated on shelf and desk a
goodly number of works of another class&mdash;books and treatises that
bear the name <i lang="es">Arte</i> = Aids to Learning, whereof you
will encounter very many in Retana.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">Arte</i> of a given dialect, as will be found true
also in a measure for grammars and other school-manuals, will be
recognized as a compendium of not only literary rules, but of many
practical maxims of daily life, whereby the pupils are urged not only
to correct speech, but to upright conduct as well through sobriety,
piety to the Supreme Being, obedience to rulers, respect for parents
and fellows, according to the noblest ideals of refined Christian
manhood and womanhood. Thus, with grammar were taught ethics; with
politics, religion.</p>
<p>Referring here to class-books in the Philippines, where from the
earliest years of the conquest every <i lang="es">pueblo</i> had its
school of primary instruction, it will not be irrelevant to point out
the fact very stoutly that though education (as admitted by well-nigh
every chronicler) was primitive in character,&mdash;and in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries where was it not? yet the course of
instruction given in the common schools of bamboo-thatch was (as
results amply testify) deep and solid enough for the intellectual
calibre of the people. Since, so far as known, Malaysia, however
saintly, heroic, innocent, the same as our own aborigines, albeit now
civilized for three centuries and upwards, has, despite the heartiest
aid in teachers and funds, fairly lavished on them by Church and state,
turned out no man of shining mark, no scholar, no artist, no genius in
statecraft or commerce. The first college-institution with pretensions
to higher courses of intellectual training was opened (formally at
least) by the Jesuits in 1601, less than half a century, that is, after
the arrival of Europeans in Luzon.</p>
<p>In regard to common Indian schools, so zealously guarded by the
<i lang="es">Leyes de las Indias</i>, I have picked up here and there
from old-time chroniclers scraps of many ordinances passed by the crown
relative to their foundation and conduct. Among them the following bits
of quaint old-fashioned oversight of the dominies in charge. Thus, in
1754, I have read that each <i lang="es">maestro</i> of a
mission-school was to get, in lieu of support, &ldquo;a <i lang=
"es">peso</i> and one <i lang="es">caban</i>&mdash;a measure&mdash;of
rice a month.&rdquo; (A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span><i lang="es">caban</i> was equal to
75 <i>litres</i>, about the same number of quarts, English.) Again,
every mission-priest was called upon to supply (free to his pupils)
&ldquo;paper and ink.&rdquo; Moreover, as early as the beginning of the
century just closing, in 1817, it was ordained that boys&rsquo; schools
were to be kept on the ground-floor of the mission-house; while the
girls were to be taught at their mistress&rsquo; home.
(Malaysia&mdash;thus it was ordained&mdash;was not to experiment with
the &ldquo;co-educational theory.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Now for the promised works of chief authority on Philippine
linguistics,&mdash;monuments of the various dialects of that
archipelago, that, along with their purely technical value to the
student of idioms, will be acknowledged as useful to scholars in even
far different lines of intellectual play.</p>
<p>Of the best works for the study of Visaya, or Bisaya, first dialect
in the islands acquired by missionary and <i lang=
"es">conquistador</i>, wherein he gives 352 titles (p. xxix), Retana
has the following: &ldquo;Up to a few years ago the dictionary held in
highest repute by linguists was the work of the Augustinian scholar
Alonso de M&eacute;ntrida,&rdquo; a vocabulary of the Hiligueina, or
Hiligayno, and Haraya tongues&mdash;two of the three chief dialects
spoken in Panay, not very different from the Visaya of Ceb&uacute;,
used, however, by the less cultured tribes of hillsmen in that island.
This vocabulary, first printed in 1637, and in 1841 republished at
Manila, with diagrams of Indian alphabets, enlarged in another edition
in 1842, by a brother missionary, Juli&aacute;n Mart&iacute;n, has now
been supplanted by the Visaya-Spanish dictionary (in two volumes), of
another Augustinian scholar, Juan F&eacute;lix de la
Encarnaci&oacute;n, printed at Manila, first, in 1851&ndash;1852, then
in 1866 and again in 1885.</p>
<p>Another work deserving of praise is the <i lang="es">Arte</i> of the
Visaya idiom in use in the islands of S&aacute;mar and Leite (Binondo,
1872), composed by the Franciscan traveler, Antonio Figuerroa, in which
latter language&mdash;Leite, that with slight changes is similar to
Cebuano, the first grammar was published by the Jesuit missionary,
Domingo Ezquerra, in 1662.</p>
<p>Helpful, too, as much as the former <i lang="es">Arte</i> in
philology is the <i>Christian Doctrine</i> translated into
Visaya-Cebuano by the Recoleto scholar and orator, Tom&aacute;s de San
Jer&oacute;nimo, known to his contemporaries as &ldquo;the Cicero of
Ceb&uacute;.&rdquo; His school-book re-issued at Binondo in 1876 is a
reprint of his edition of 1731.</p>
<p>Of the Tagal dialect,&mdash;a form of speech so hard to acquire with
nicety that, according to a Spanish saying, one needs therefor
&ldquo;<i lang="es">un <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span>a&ntilde;o de arte y dos de
bahaque</i>,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e756src" href="#xd20e756"
name="xd20e756src">2</a> that is to say, unless I am wrong in my
interpretation of the last word&mdash;&ldquo;<i>bahaque</i>&rdquo;
which likely is Aeta, the scholar needs &ldquo;a year of study and two
of practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest Tagal <i lang="es">Arte</i>, so styled in chronicles,
for what with the universal destructive touch of time, and in Luzon
especially, the voracity of that pest of librarians, the
<i>anay</i>,&mdash;an ant that in a few hours, it is said, will devour
a library,&mdash;cases as well as books, not a sole copy, apparently,
has survived, was composed in 1580 by the Augustinian voyager and
missionary, Agust&iacute;n de Albuquerque, fourth superior of his
brotherhood in the Philippines, and printed at Manila in 1637.</p>
<p>In Tagal the works most highly praised are the following: The
Critical Treatise on Tagalisms (Mexico, 1742), by the Franciscan
linguist, Melchior Oyanguren, the only work known wherein that tongue
is contrasted on scientific lines with the classic Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew, and Mandarin Chinese. The author was moved to prepare his
manual for the instruction of his brother missionaries prior to their
entrance into their field of work in Luzon.</p>
<p>The Tagal dictionary, by the Jesuit missionary, Juan de Noceda, and
others of his society (Manila, 1754), a lexicographical treasure, was
reprinted at Valladolid in 1836, and (in its most highly-prized form)
again, in 1860, at Manila, with valuable additions by some Augustinian
experts.</p>
<p>For the scholar unacquainted with Latin, the most serviceable work
for learning Tagal is the Essay on Tagal Grammar (Manila, 1878),
composed by the Recoleto missionary and linguist, Toribio Minguella de
la Merced, whose Grammar (in the same language) for the use of children
(Manila, 1886) was adopted for schools by the Spanish government.</p>
<p>While another helpful work for the study of that same dialect is the
Tagal catechism, by the Augustinian, Luis de Amezquita, a popular
booklet, first printed in 1666, and (in its thirteenth edition) in
1880, at Manila.</p>
<p>A rare and precious treatise, praised for its critical spirit, is
the study on Tagal poetry&mdash;a compendium of that dialect reprinted
at Sampaloc <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>in 1787, from the first edition of 1703; and again
at Manila, in 1879, by another member of the same brotherhood, Gaspar
de San Agust&iacute;n, author, besides, of one of the most valued
<i lang="es">Conquistas</i>, or histories of the islands.</p>
<p>For the study of Tagal refrains&mdash;for this people is
ballad-lover to the core&mdash;and similar turns of speech, an
excellent work, one unique of its kind, is the <i lang=
"es">Colecci&oacute;n</i> (Guadalupe, 1890), by two well-known
Franciscan linguists, Gregorio Mart&iacute;n and Mariano
Mart&iacute;nez Cuadrado.</p>
<p>The Tagal <i lang="es">Arte</i> (Sampaloc, 1745), along with a
manual (also in Tagal) for the administration of the Sacraments,
composed by the Franciscan missionary, Sebasti&aacute;n de Totanes,
&ldquo;is&rdquo; (according to our bibliographer) &ldquo;the best
edition of the best grammar&rdquo; written by missionaries of that
order.</p>
<p>In Ilocano, another of the unnumbered dialects of Luzon, there is a
good dictionary (Manila, 1849), by the Augustinian scholar,
Andr&eacute;s Carro (aided by others of his brotherhood)&mdash;the
first work of its kind, reprinted only a few years ago, in 1888.
Serviceable, too, for the study of the same
dialect&mdash;Ilocano&mdash;as doubtless easy to obtain, is the
<i lang="es">Catecismo</i>, by another member of that same order,
Francisco L&oacute;pez (Manila, 1877), whereof editions fairly without
number have issued.</p>
<p>In Batanes, or Vatanes, a dialect used in the islets north of Luzon,
mission-field of the Dominicans, hard to reach, nor easy at best to
live in, is composed the Catechism of the Christian Doctrine (Manila,
1834), by a missionary of that order&mdash;the only work, perhaps,
printed in that language, wherein Retana states he is about to edit a
grammar and dictionary. In his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> (p. 51) he
gives the <i lang="es">Ave Maria</i> in Batanes, Ibanag and Ilocano, in
order to show (he says) the diversities between these idioms.</p>
<p>The Pampanga <i lang="es">Arte</i> (Manila, 1729), by the
Augustinian, Diego Berga&ntilde;o, an estimable aid to the would-be
learner of that language, was reissued at Sampaloc in 1736. By the same
author is a dictionary of Pampanga&mdash;the only work of its class,
printed at Manila, first in 1732, and again in 1860.</p>
<p>In the Ibanag tongue, otherwise Ibanay or Cagayan, the dictionary by
the Dominican linguist, Jos&eacute; Bugar&iacute;n, and companions
(Manila, 1854), we have what Retana styles a masterpiece of
philological craft, &ldquo;the first and (in fact) only vocabulary of
that dialect&rdquo; whereof of all Philippine tongues &ldquo;the
orthography is the most difficult to manage.&rdquo; In another place,
however (p. 102), he has named another Ibanag dictionary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>(Manila,
1867), constructed from Dominican MSS., to which similarly (by error I
suppose) he has awarded seniority of press. Prior to the above
date&mdash;1854&mdash;in that vast region of Cagayan, where, by the
way, is grown the choicest tobacco in the Philippines, the
missionaries, for generation and generation of island-pupils had relied
wholly on MS. copies of Padre Bugar&iacute;n&rsquo;s dictionary.</p>
<p>In Pangasin&aacute;n, or Caboalan, dialect used in the province of
the same name in Luzon, we have another linguistic treasure&mdash;the
<i lang="es">Arte</i> of Mariano Pellicer, of the same brotherhood,
reprinted at Manila, in 1862, from the edition of 1690, whereof in the
course of time, as writers tell us, it came to pass that up to about
the middle of the present century only one copy survived. Then re-cast
by Pellicer, in 1840, it was re-published by him some twenty years
later.</p>
<p>Of the Cuyona dialect I note two works of merit,&mdash;one (p. 113)
an explanation of the Christian Doctrine (Manila, 1871), by the
Recoleto missionary, Pedro Gibert de Santa Eulalia, edited by the
Dominican Mariano Cuartero, first bishop of St. Isabel, or Elizabeth,
of Jaro, in the island of Panay, one of the four suffragans of Manila,
an industrious scholar, editor of many works in Indian dialects, whom
the reader, however, is not to confound with another prelate of the
same name, Recoleto bishop of Nueva Segovia, in Luzon, nephew of the
former, who, in this one respect, was like his uncle&mdash;author of no
book: while the other Cuyona treasure, whereof there are very few in
that language, (&ldquo;<span lang="es">poquisimos libros</span>,&rdquo;
says Retana, p. 230), seven titles in all comprising the bibliography
of that tongue, is the Plan of Religion (Manila, 1886), by the same
industrious and scholarly Gibert.</p>
<p>In the Gaddan idiom, wherein only two books have been printed, both
very devotional in character, is a Catechism (Manila, 1833), and the
Pathway to Heaven (<i>ib.</i>, 1873), by Dominican missionaries in the
provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Isabela, in Luzon.</p>
<p>In the Aeta language of the Negritos, or little black men, perhaps
the primitive race of the Philippines&mdash;whose name I have
encountered in many forms of spelling, as Ata, Ataa, Aeta, Agta, Aita,
Ita, Itaa,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e860src" href="#xd20e860" name=
"xd20e860src">3</a> there are similarly, only two works known to
Retana, whose bibliographical notices have been of so much
value,&mdash;one a Report on the Philippine Islands (Paris, 1885),
addressed to the French Minister of Public Instruction by J. Montano, a
book of over two hundred and nine pages, illumined with numerous
phototypes, and, what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>renders it of exceptional value, enriched
with vocabularies, &ldquo;the first,&rdquo; Retana declares, in Aeta,
Bilaan, Manobo (of the natives of Mindanao), S&aacute;mal and Tagacaolo
dialects.</p>
<p>As companion volume to the above, though far smaller in bulk, is a
little treatise (Dresden, 1893), of double authorship, the German A. B.
Meyer giving therein a very interesting Aeta vocabulary, and his Dutch
co-laborer, H. Kern, a comparative study of the same tongue, which he
traces to Malay ancestry.</p>
<p>For the study of Chamorro, idiom of the Marianas Islands, one will
find serviceable the little book of devotions (Manila, 1887), with
counsels for the worthy reception of the Sacraments of God, (p.
248)&mdash;the only work, in fact, we have in this dialect, by the
Recoleto linguist and traveler, Aniceto Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez del
Carmen.</p>
<p>Finally, with three other samples of the Philippine press as proofs
of the variety of its polyglot fonts, and I shall have done with this
digression on the many languages used in this part of
Polynesia,&mdash;one a grammar in the dialect of Yap or Guap (p. 248),
in the western Caroline archipelago (Manila, 1888), composed apparently
by the Capuchin missionary, Ambrosio de Valencia; the second (p. 332) a
Hispano-Kanaka dictionary (Tamb&oacute;bong, 1892), by another Capuchin
wanderer, according to Retana, Agust&iacute;n Mar&iacute;a de
Ari&ntilde;ez. While the last, a work, as will readily be acknowledged,
of interest as well as importance to ethnologists, linguists,
Americanists especially, is the list of Nahuatlisms of Costa Rica (San
Jos&eacute; de Costa Rica, 1892), by Juan Fern&aacute;ndez Ferraz, a
goodly-sized volume of over two hundred pages, wherein, on purely
linguistic grounds, the author has maintained the kinship of our own
Central Americans and the Philippinians, from the fact especially that
in the respective countries of these two antipodal peoples, abound very
many terms of every-day use, with identical spelling and meaning. In
his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> (p. 340), Retana has gathered a few of
these homonyms and synonyms.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the chief authorities on language among our
Philippina that, while entertaining, nay instructing the philologist,
will delight also the general student, the writers whereof, as the
reader will not be slow to observe, were in far larger number all
churchmen and missionaries.</p>
<p>In fact, of the 1142 authors, whose works he has enumerated
(<i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>, xxxv&ndash;xxxvi), Retana states that
four hundred and sixty-six are ecclesiastics, that is, ninety-eight
secular clergymen and three hundred and sixty-eight members of
religious brotherhoods, whereof the Augustinians<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>&mdash;the writer&rsquo;s own
order&mdash;numbering one hundred and forty-one authors, inclusive of
thirty-seven Recoletos&mdash;the bare-footed branch of that
fraternity&mdash;figure highest. Next in rank, we have one hundred
Dominicans, then fifty-seven Jesuits, fifty-six Franciscans, and
fourteen authors of orders not specified.</p>
<p>Of these brotherhoods, who thus in Malaysia, as in other quarters of
the globe, brought forth so brilliant an array of scholars and
philanthropists, the first-named, the Augustinians, with Legazpi,
crossing two oceans and one continent therefore, found a home in the
Philippines at the conquest of that archipelago in 1565; in 1577 the
first Franciscans reached the isles; in 1581, the Dominicans, with the
first bishop of Manila (by actual possession), Domingo Salazar, member
of the same brotherhood, accompanied too by some Jesuits, while the
Recoletos first crossed the Pacific in 1611.</p>
<p>These churchmen, with very few exceptions Spanish, with later on a
sprinkling of Portuguese, Dutchmen, Germans, Italians and Irishmen,
scholars, as a rule, of fair repute, some even of European eminence,
from their advent into Polynesia, besides their care in implanting
Christian altruism, wherewith only (as history attests) thrive science
and art, have toiled ever since to imbue these islanders, whom they
found heathen&mdash;without letters, laws, or settled abode&mdash;with
learning, the arts of husbandry, building, carving, painting, weaving,
and the like graces of intellectual grandeur&mdash;in brief, with
whatever of civilization now marks Malaysian genius.</p>
<p>From Manila, as centre of intellectual enlightenment for all eastern
Asiatic and Polynesian lands in the sixteenth century, were
transplanted the germs of philanthropy&mdash;of wisdom and
charity&mdash;to Borneo, the Carolines, Moluccas, as well as the
mainland of Asia, to China and Japan, while in India the Portuguese,
with headquarters at Goa, fulfilled the same destiny as their Iberian
brothers.</p>
<p>Speaking of the heroism of these self-exiled churchmen and
worshipers of the Christian Minerva in Asiatic tropics, I quote the
words of the famed French savant, Elis&eacute;e Reclus, a witness, by
the way, in no measure partial to cloister life. In his Universal

<h2 class="main">Some Literary Curios among Philippina.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">Among the curios of artistic and literary cast,
your bright-minded reader, if on the alert to spy anything deserving of
notice, will find here and there in Retana&rsquo;s pages enshrined many
a bit of out-of-the-way information. The following half dozen or so of
oddities will probably be acknowledged, not unworthy of mention among
these Philippina:</p>
<p>They are <i lang="es">La Razon</i>: A Plea Against Certain Vexatious
Encroachments of the Crown on Mexican and Manila Trade, by Jos&eacute;
Nu&ntilde;o de Villavicencio (Sampaloc, 1737), which bears on its cover
the most tasty design by Philippine burin&mdash;a plate illustrative of
the contents of the Plea, engraved by Francisco Su&aacute;rez, a Tagal
artist.</p>
<p><i lang="es">El Cosmopolita</i>&mdash;The
Cosmopolitan&mdash;(Manila, 1895&ndash;1896), the first periodical (p.
458), with phototypes, published in the islands.</p>
<p>The first Almanac and Guide-Book for strangers and travelers, with a
Map of the Archipelago, was issued at Manila for the year 1834.</p>
<p>The newspaper&mdash;<i lang="es">El Ilocano</i>&mdash;a bi-weekly,
published in Spanish and Ilocano at Manila (p. 464), from 1889 to 1896
(?) was the first periodical written in Indian dialect.</p>
<p>Again, another periodical&mdash;<i lang="es">El Hogar</i> (p. 464),
The Fireside&mdash;a weekly, of 16 pages, started at Manila in 1892,
under the direction of Madam Amparo G&oacute;mez de la Serna, was the
first paper devoted to science, letters, beaux-arts, and useful
information published almost exclusively in the interests of women,
while the <i lang="es">Revista de Filipinas</i> (p. 132), a bi-weekly,
that, starting at Manila in 1875, lived only two years, is the
worthiest of Philippine periodicals, noticeable chiefly for the deeply
scientific cast of its papers.</p>
<p>The <i lang="es">Romancero Filipino</i>, a work of fancy (Manila,
1892), by Manuel Romero Aquino, is styled (p. 554) by Retana the
neatest and best piece of work by Philippine pen.</p>
<p>While <i>The American Soldier</i>, a four-page daily newspaper,
whereof the opening number is dated Manila, September 10, 1898, is the
first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>periodical, maybe print of any sort, in the
English language, published in the islands.</p>
<p>With the foregoing extravaganzas of literature we note that the
series of Philippine periodicals, which in Retana&rsquo;s own
collection number (he says) one hundred and twelve, in their entirety
do not surpass one hundred and sixty. Of his own he gives the titles
(<i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>, xxiii&ndash;xxviii) from <i lang="es">Del
Superior Gobierno</i>, the first newspaper issued in the islands, with
the imprint of Manila, August 8, 1811, down to the
latest&mdash;<i lang="es">Th&eacute; Kon Leche</i> (Tea and
Milk)&mdash;a four-page weekly satirical periodical, with illustrations
(in two colors), published at Manila in 1898.</p>
<p>The oldest piece of what we may style distinctively Philippine
literature, whereof, moreover, only one copy is believed to be extant,
albeit printed abroad in Europe, is an Account of Legazpi&rsquo;s
Expedition from Mexico to Ceb&uacute; in 1565, sent from Seville to one
Miguel Salvador, of Valencia, and printed one year later at Barcelona.
This <i lang="es">Copia</i>&mdash;thus entitled in Retana&mdash;heads
his list of Philippina, a study of which, with the supplement (p. 505
<i>et seq.</i>), discloses the fact that of the books that head his
<i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>, the first nineteen were printed
abroad&mdash;eighteen in Europe; that is, nine in Spain, at Barcelona,
Madrid, Burgos, Valencia and Seville; seven in Italy, at Rome, Genoa
and Venice; one each in France, at Paris, and in Flanders, at Antwerp
(&ldquo;Amberes&rdquo; in the Spanish), where a Mendoza&rsquo;s History
of China was printed in 1596, by Bellero; and the nineteenth in
Mexico.</p>
<p>The first fruit itself of the Philippine press&mdash;thus styled by
Retana, though mistakenly, we judge&mdash;was the Spanish-Japanese
Dictionary of 1630, on which I will make some remarks when treating of
the early Philippine press.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is noticeable that of these earliest Philippina not one
of them treats distinctively of religious matters, but&mdash;with the
exception of two, Fragoso&rsquo;s and Acosta&rsquo;s Botanies, or works
on Eastern flora&mdash;are wholly historical in character, embracing,
as they do, along with the <i lang="es">Copia</i> of 1566, eleven
editions of the still estimable history of China and other Asiatic
lands, by the Augustinian traveler, Juan Gonz&aacute;lez de Mendoza,
whereof the Roman edition (by Vincenzo Acolti in 1585) gives plates
illustrative of Chinese typographical symbols&mdash;the first shown to
Europeans. Of this history, it may be observed, thirty-eight editions
have appeared in all&mdash;in Latin, Spanish, Italian, French, German,
Dutch, and English. Among these early Philippina&mdash;to continue our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>analysis&mdash;is a history of that archipelago,
by the Franciscan chronicler, Marcelo de Ribadeneyra; a report on the
same islands, by the Jesuit scholar, Pedro Chirino&mdash;the first work
of its kind published in Europe (Rome, 1604), with diagrams of
Philippine characters&mdash;signs, namely, employed by the natives in
writing, whereof, says Retana, &ldquo;a miserable edition&rdquo; was
printed at Manila in 1890. Then follow other works, among them a story
of the conquest of the Moluccas, one of the sixteenth century names of
the Philippines, a work of utmost value to the historical writer,
composed by the presbyter, <span class="corr" id="xd20e986" title=
"Source: Bartholom&eacute;">Bartolom&eacute;</span> Leonardo de
Argensola (Madrid, 1609); then a trustworthy account of the triumph of
Spanish arms in the Philippines, by Antonio de Morga, auditor-general
of the crown in those colonies, printed in Mexico in 1609; and lastly
the report of Governor Francisco Guzman de Tello, eleventh
captain-general of those islands (Seville, 1598?).</p>
<p>The two merely scientific works, alluded to ahead, are
&ldquo;Discourses on Aromatic Things&mdash;Plants, Fruit, and the like
simple Medicines employed in the East Indies,&rdquo; composed by Juan
Fragoso, a rare and curious work (Madrid, 1572); and a Treatise on the
Drugs and Medicines used in the East Indies, with plates representing
various plants, by Crist&oacute;bal Acosta, published first in Spanish
at Burgos in 1578; in Latin (in two editions) in 1582 and 1593; in
French (also in two editions) in 1602 and 1619; lastly in English in
1604. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=

<h2 class="main">Philippine Presses.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">Now for a description of the different
printing-presses&mdash;or, rather, places&mdash;in the Philippines,
from the earliest named by Retana in his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>,
in all fourteen distinct localities, where printing was carried on in
the three islands of Luzon, Panay and Ceb&uacute;.</p>
<p>1.&mdash;From an analysis of the titles I find that Manila ranks
earliest, where (with limitations to be set later) a printing-press was
established in 1630, in which year, at the Dominican College of St.
Thomas, a Spanish-Japanese dictionary, the work of Portuguese Jesuit
missionaries and scholars, now translated into Spanish, was printed by
Tom&aacute;s Pinpin, a native Tagal, and Jacinto Magaurlua. This
dictionary (now extremely rare), even though not the first book printed
in the islands, as stated by Retana, must yet be ranked among the
earliest specimens of Philippine literature.</p>
<p>In his Bibliography three different titles (we may observe) bear the
imprint of Manila, with the name of this city spelled according to the
ancient aboriginal form, albeit but slightly varied from the
present&mdash;&ldquo;Maynila&rdquo;&mdash;otherwise, as I have read it,
&ldquo;Mainilla,&rdquo; a variant in orthography one encounters in old
chronicles&mdash;a Tagal word (it seems) signifying a species of shrub
or bush, in the Spanish rendered <i lang="es">arbusto</i>, that in 1571
was found to cover the site of the new city projected by the <i lang=
"es">conquistadores</i>, under the leadership of Miguel L&oacute;pez de
Legazpi.</p>
<p>In this same year, it may be added, the site of the future
metropolis of Malaysia was taken possession of by Spanish arms, with
due observance of ceremonial, sealed with the three local
chieftains,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1014src" href="#xd20e1014" name=
"xd20e1014src">1</a> Lacandola, Matand&aacute; and Soliman, by
blood-bargain&mdash;<i lang="es">pacto de sangre</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1020src" href="#xd20e1020" name="xd20e1020src">2</a> Here,
too, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>at Manila, the second church in Malaysia devoted
to the Supreme Being, the first having been founded at Ceb&uacute;, was
dedicated the same year (1571) to God, under the most fitting title of
the Conversion of St. Paul the Apostle, first great missionary to
heathendom. At Ceb&uacute;, by agreement with Chief Tupas, the standard
of Christian comity&mdash;the Cross&mdash;had been reared in 1565, and
its church dedicated in honor of St. Michael Archangel, name-saint of
Legazpi, though shortly after rechristened <i lang="es">El Santo
Ni&ntilde;o</i>&mdash;the Holy Child&mdash;its title to-day.</p>
<p>The three works then printed at &ldquo;Maynila,&rdquo; or Bush Town,
in Luzon, are a Manual of Devotions to St. Roch, translated into Tagal
by the Augustinian missionary, Esteban Diez, a skilled Tagalist, in
1820; a periodical&mdash;the <i lang="es">Revista
Cat&oacute;lica</i>&mdash;whereof the first and only number (p. 309)
was issued in 1890; and lastly, a weekly paper (the same as the former)
in Tagal, published in 1896.</p>
<p>2.&mdash;The second place to witness the establishment of a press
was Sampaloc, in Zambales province, in Luzon, where, in 1736, at the
Franciscan convent of Our Lady of Loreto, was printed the Augustinian
Diego Berga&ntilde;o&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Arte</i>, in
Pampanga&mdash;first fruit, it seems, of typographical genius in that
<i lang="es">pueblo</i>. While the last imprint with the name of
Sampaloc is an almanac, or church calendar, for the year 1838 (more
probably, however, printed the year ahead), when the old press, founded
by Franciscan friars a hundred years before, disappears.</p>
<p>3.&mdash;At Tayabas, in the province of the same name, in Luzon (p.
31), was printed a Tagal dictionary, by the Franciscan, Totanes, now
supplanted, however, by Noceda&rsquo;s far superior work on
philological score, especially with the additions made thereto by the
Augustinians in the Manila edition of 1860. This Tayabas imprint is the
only work I have encountered with the name of that <i lang=
"es">pueblo</i>.</p>
<p>4.&mdash;The first Cavite imprint (p. 38) dates (it seems) from
1815&mdash;a church calendar for the following year; while the last,
with the name of this Manila suburb written, however, with a
K&mdash;&ldquo;Kavite&rdquo;&mdash;is an appeal of the revolutionary
party in 1898 (p. 451), under the official seal of the <i lang=
"es">Gobierno Dictatorial de Filipinas</i>.</p>
<p>5.&mdash;Binondo is the fifth place, whereof the first
work&mdash;statistical reports of Franciscan missionaries&mdash;was
printed in 1865; the last, Jos&eacute; Patricio Clemente&rsquo;s Moral
Lectures for Youth (p. 540), in 1872. In regard, however, to this town,
it should be observed that in his earlier bibliography (ed. 1893)
Retana names a work printed by Pinpin in the Hospital of St. Gabriel,
at Binondo, in 1623. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>6.&mdash;At Vigan, the old Villa Fernandina of the Ilocos, known
also to Spaniards as Nueva Segovia, a city founded in the sixteenth
century by Juan Salcedo, one of the captains under Legazpi, and so
christened by him in memory of his native place in Spain, but now known
as Lalo, or Lal-lo,&mdash;here was started a Sunday newspaper, <i lang=
"es">El Eco de Vigan</i>, published in Ilocano in 1883, that died,
however, a year after birth.</p>
<p>7.&mdash;In Iloilo (on the island of Panay) was printed, in 1885,
the pastoral letter of Alejandro Arru&eacute;, Recoleto bishop of St.
Isabel, or Elizabeth, of Jaro.</p>
<p>8.&mdash;Then comes Guadalupe, eighth place on our list, a sanctuary
village on the left bank of the river Tasig, a couple of leagues from
Manila, a shrine founded by Augustinians in 1601, in honor of St.
Nicholas, the wonder-worker of Tolentino, a place visited yearly by
great numbers of Chinese Confucians, as well as Christians, who hold
that saint in highest and most singular veneration. At Guadalupe, in
1886, issued two works from the orphanage press&mdash;An Abridgment of
the Christian Doctrine of Pouguet and Fleuri, drawn up in Bisaya by
Father Mateo P&eacute;rez, Augustinian cure of Argao; and
Lozano&rsquo;s Novena to St. Thomas of Villanova. The last imprint of
Guadalupe&mdash;a Tagal Catechism, by Luis de Amezquita, a brother
missionary of P&eacute;rez&mdash;bears the date 1890.</p>
<p>9.&mdash;The earliest sample of Ceb&uacute; print&mdash;the island
where, under Legazpi, three centuries earlier, civilization first found
a footing in Malaysia&mdash;is a work that elicits from Retana
remarkable praise, in view of the difficulties that attended its
printing; the paper&mdash;such was the dearth in the Visayas of proper
material for good press-work&mdash;being of five or six different
qualities in body, make, color. This work, that I think we may style a
triumph of adaptive art, is the <i lang="es">Ensayo para una
Galer&iacute;a de Asturianos ilustres</i>, a genealogical monument (in
three volumes), by the Augustinian antiquary, Fabi&aacute;no
Rodr&iacute;guez, begun in 1888 and completed in 1893. While the last
Ceb&uacute; imprint, a government statistical report on crime and the
like, is dated 1892.</p>
<p>10.&mdash;Tamb&oacute;bong, a <i lang="es">pueblo</i> near the
coast, in Tondo province, about three miles from Manila, comes tenth in
our list, where, at the orphan asylum of Our Lady of Consolation, in
1889, was printed a weekly newspaper&mdash;the <i lang="es">Revista
Cat&oacute;lica de Filipinas</i>&mdash;discontinued in 1896. While the
last imprint from this press&mdash;An Abridgment of the History of
Spain (of only eight pages)&mdash;was issued, presumably, in 1897.</p>
<p>11.&mdash;At Nueva Caceres, or Camarines, in Luzon, a town founded
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>the sixteenth century by Governor Francisco Sande,
in memory of his birthplace in Estremadura, but now known even
officially as Naga, the first work bearing the name of that <i lang=
"es">pueblo</i>&mdash;a hand-book of devotions&mdash;issued from the
press of the <i lang="es">Sagrada Familia</i>, in 1893; and two years
later (in 1895) the last&mdash;A Life of St. Monica and her son, St.
Augustine&mdash;written, the same as the former, in B&iacute;col
dialect.</p>
<p>12.&mdash;In 1895, we read the earliest printed samples of
Malab&oacute;n art&mdash;a poetical tribute of gratitude to Our Lady of
Welcome&mdash;<i lang="es">Bien-Venida</i>, one of the many titles of
the Mother of God, so dear to Philippine soul, by Fructuoso Arias
Camis&oacute;n, from the orphan-press of Our Lady of Consolation (in
care of Augustinians). Only once, it may be noted, is the name of this
<i lang="es">pueblo</i>&mdash;encountered quite frequently in Retana,
the same (he says) as Tamb&oacute;bong, written
&ldquo;Malab&oacute;ng,&rdquo; a somewhat unusual form of
spelling&mdash;employed by Manuel Sastr&oacute;n, in his description of
Batangas, printed in 1895.</p>
<p>From several specimens of Malab&oacute;n press-work, now before me,
I may observe that, for accuracy in composition, neatness&mdash;in
brief, of general excellence in workmanship&mdash;these samples of the
orphanage establishment at Malab&oacute;n would not fail to honor even
a Philadelphia craftsman.</p>
<p>Two years ago (in 1898), just prior to the siege of Manila, under
the care of two Fathers and four lay-brothers of the Augustinians,
resident at this orphan asylum, one hundred and one lads were being
taught the following trades: 13 compositors, 12 press-workers, 30
bookbinders, 3 gilders, 43 candlemakers, while 44 other youngsters, too
small for hard work, were, the same as their seniors, given food,
clothing, and shelter;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1105src" href=
"#xd20e1105" name="xd20e1105src">3</a> while similarly, at Mandaloya
orphan asylum for girls, conducted by twenty-two sisters (of the same
order), a hundred and twenty-two lassies were taught music (piano),
painting, drawing, embroidery, flower-, lace- and dress-making,
hair-dressing, laundry-work, and sewing.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1111src" href="#xd20e1111" name="xd20e1111src">4</a></p>
<p>But alas! it is feared that through the grim fate of war a like
disaster, as has wrecked many another fair shrine of learning and art
in countries even nearer our own, has befallen our studios and
laboratories at Malab&oacute;n and Mandaloya, that therefrom their
inmates&mdash;orphans, instructors and care-takers are now wanderers,
with their treasures ravished, their homes destroyed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>13.&mdash;Then we meet with a work printed in 1896, at the
revolutionary press at Imus, in Cavite province, in Luzon,&mdash;a
proclamation (in Tagal)&mdash;the only imprint bearing the name of this
<i lang="es">pueblo</i>.</p>
<p>14.&mdash;Finally, in 1898, at Mandaloyon, or Mandaloya (named
ahead), an old <i lang="es">hacienda</i> of the Augustinians in Tondo
province, in Luzon, the morning-paper&mdash;<i lang="es">La
Rep&uacute;blica Filipina</i>&mdash;began publication with the flag of
the new-born republic in colors for heading,&mdash;the first journal of
the Tagal insurgents, that had so much to do in bringing about the
downfall of Spanish rule in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Before concluding this section on early presses, we may add the
references made by Retana to other Philippine prints than the ones
given in his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>. In a former work<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1139src" href="#xd20e1139" name="xd20e1139src">5</a>
he states that by certain writers, whom he names, presses were said to
have been established on the isle of Luzon, viz: at Bacolor in 1619;
Macabebe in 1621; and Tayabas in 1703. Similarly, he cites two works,
named by the Franciscan antiquarian Huerta as having been printed at
Manila earlier than the Bugar&iacute;n dictionary&mdash;the <i lang=
"es">Devocion Tagalog</i> in 1610; and a <i lang="es">Diccionario</i>
in 1613, both (according to Huerta) from the press of Tom&aacute;s
Pinpin, the Tagal printer. Moreover, under the heading of
&ldquo;Manila&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pinpin,&rdquo; Retana gives the dates
of several still older imprints than the Japanese dictionary of 1630,
which in his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> has been accorded the honor of
senior of the Philippine press.</p>
<p>The reason for the omission of these titles in Retana&rsquo;s later
bibliography, that otherwise would seem unaccountable, is perhaps a
doubt as to their genuinity. But why he should fail to mention this
flaw in their line of ancestral title, is like many another perplexing
problem that the scholar is apt to encounter in his wanderings through
the shadowy, albeit delightful and fascinating realm of letters.</p>
<p>We now pass on to the question of the introduction of the press into
the Philippines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=

<h2 class="main">Introduction of Printing into the Philippines.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="firstpar">As regards the introduction of printing itself into
that archipelago, wherein (as writers agree) the first press was set to
work in the opening years of the seventeenth century, yet there is
dispute as to two points,&mdash;the precise date, namely, when the
printing-press was first established there, and the country whence it
was carried to those islands.</p>
<p>Though in his <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i> Retana inferentially
states that the Spanish-Japanese Dictionary of 1630 was the earliest
Philippine imprint, yet in another work of a few years ahead, one of
his numerous valuable appendices to Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s
Travels,<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1171src" href="#xd20e1171" name=
"xd20e1171src">1</a> the same author has maintained, rightly and
soundly enough it would seem, a wholly different opinion. There he
reproduces the title-page of a work printed twenty years earlier, in
1610, which he himself saw in the <span lang="es">Museo Biblioteca de
Ultramar</span>, whereof the title (he declares) is as follows:</p>
<p lang="es">Arte y Reglas | de la Lengua | Tagala. | Por el Padre. F.
Fray Francisco de. S. Joseph de la | Ord&#275; de. S. Domingo
Predicador General en la Prouincia | de. N. Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario
de las Islas Filipinas. |</p>
<p>[<i>Here the Grand Seal of the Dominican Order</i> (in wood) <i>with
this legend</i>:]</p>
<p lang="es">| Mihi avtem ab | sit glorianisi incruce D&ntilde;i
&Ntilde;ri IESVXPIAD&mdash;| GAL. 6. |</p>
<p lang="es">| En el Partido de Bataan | galo, A&ntilde;o de 1610.
|</p>
<p>Substantially the aforesaid title means that the book&mdash;a Tagal
grammar&mdash;was composed by Father Francisco de S. Joseph (whose
family-name (as otherwise known) was Blancas), of the Dominican Order,
preacher-general of his province of Our Lady of the Rosary in the
Philippines, and printed at Bataan, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
1610.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1199src" href="#xd20e1199" name=
"xd20e1199src">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>In one of his Appendices to Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga,<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1205src" href="#xd20e1205" name="xd20e1205src">3</a> Retana
affirms that the printer of this <i lang="es">Arte</i> was the Tagal
Tom&aacute;s Pinpin.</p>
<p>Why, then, with this sample of early Philippine typography before
his eyes, presumably yet extant on the shelves of the <span lang=
"es">Museo de Ultramar</span>, Retana (whose interesting description of
Blancas&rsquo; <i lang="es">Arte</i> of 1610 will shortly follow)
should have deemed it right to omit all mention of it in his latest
bibliography, wherein, so far as I can read, there is not the slightest
reference to it, seems truly a literary conundrum&mdash;one that, for
me at least, baffles all power of solution.</p>
<p>However, accepting facts in the world of letters, as in the
objective universe of God&rsquo;s creation, as they stand, as we see
them and know them, with the guidance of Retana himself, we now proceed
(as promised) to a description of this Tagal grammar, the earliest
specimen of Philippine typography known at least to be extant.</p>
<p>Blancas&rsquo; <i lang="es">Arte</i> is a book printed on rice
paper&mdash;<i lang="es">papel de arroz</i>&mdash;with a preface of
sixteen unnumbered pages and three hundred and eleven (of text)
numbered, that is, three hundred and twenty-seven in all, yet in one
instance wrongly paged, since the observant eye of our bibliographer
has detected that what really is page 157 in the <i lang="es">Arte</i>
has been printed &ldquo;156,&rdquo; the body of the grammar thus
comprising, not 311 pages, as the printer has made it, but in reality
312.</p>
<p>On the verso of the title (that is, page 2) are given various
licenses to print, issued among other officials by Miguel Ruiz of
Binondoc (an old form apparently for the town now known as Binondo),
this permit being dated February 6, 1609. Then follow the licenses of
Father Blancas&rsquo; own provincial superior, dated Manila, June 3,
and another official&rsquo;s, whose name (Retana says) is missing by
reason of the page having been torn, dated from Quiapo, on (month too
wanting) 24, of the same year&mdash;1609&mdash;with the former.</p>
<p>On the third page, with the date July 28, 1609, we read the names of
several Manila church-officers, eight in all, licensing Father
Blancas&rsquo; <i lang="es">Arte</i>, among them the dean of the
cathedral-chapter of Manila, the archdeacon Arellano, and Pedro de
Rojas, who, as secretary apparently of that body, adds his attestation
to the chapter-action above.</p>
<p>From pages 4 to part of 7 is a Tagal Hymn to the Holy Virgin, Mother
of Our Lord; then following the finale of this hymn, a prayer to God,
Almighty Giver of all intellectual light, for power to be granted His
servants to learn of His wisdom and ability to tell it to the Tagals.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then, following some ancient Tagal characters, comes the grammar in
chief, which has been printed (as is obvious)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1248src" href="#xd20e1248" name="xd20e1248src">4</a> from type,
bearing distinct marks of use. Wherefore, since we have now concluded
Retana&rsquo;s description of this <i lang="es">Arte</i>, we, in turn,
may observe&mdash;the inference seems lawful&mdash;that our Bataan
press of 1610 had been at work before that year, and Father
Blancas&rsquo; <i lang="es">Arte</i> is not the earliest Philippine
imprint.</p>
<p>A point made by Retana with reference to Bataan, place of imprint on
the title thereof, is to this effect that instead of Bataan, name (he
says) of a province, and in olden time of a very unimportant <i lang=
"es">pueblo</i> (known, however, more correctly as
&ldquo;Batan&rdquo;),<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1262src" href=
"#xd20e1262" name="xd20e1262src">5</a> one should read Abucay, capital
of the province of Bataan, a far likelier place for the establishment
of a printing-office.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1268src" href=
"#xd20e1268" name="xd20e1268src">6</a></p>
<p>So much, then, for the still more ancient work than
Bugar&iacute;n&rsquo;s dictionary of 1630.</p>
<p>But how much earlier than 1610, date of the Tagal <i lang=
"es">Arte</i>, or in what part of the Philippine archipelago, the press
was at work, is a puzzle, that relying on the only authorities bearing
in any manner on the priority of the press, we shall now seek to
unravel.</p>
<p>When referring to this question of early typography<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1282src" href="#xd20e1282" name="xd20e1282src">7</a>
Retana declares that there are only two authors that treat of the
introduction of the press into the Philippines,&mdash;one the history
of his province (of the Holy Rosary), which with the Philippines
embraced also China and Japan, by the Dominican traveler and
missionary, Father Diego Aduarte, whose work, published at Manila, in
1640, is the second title in our <i lang="es">Biblioteca</i>, bearing
the name of that city as place of imprint, and the only old-time
authority (in print) treating of ancient Malaysian typography.</p>
<p>The other is a history (published a few years ago) entitled <i lang=
"es">La Orden de Predicadores</i>, of the Dominicans (Madrid, 1884), by
a member of that brotherhood, Father Mart&iacute;nez-Vigil, at one time
resident at Manila, where he held a chair in the university of that
city, and now (1900) bishop of Oviedo in Spain.</p>
<p>We shall, therefore, summon these two witnesses in the question in
point of primeval Philippina.</p>
<p>Aduarte&rsquo;s reference to early typography<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1300src" href="#xd20e1300" name="xd20e1300src">8</a> contains
substantially the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>following statements: that living with the
Fathers of his Order (at Binondo) was a Christian Chinese, named Juan
de Vera, a most worthy man, printer by trade, who had learned his art
at home, and &ldquo;the first printer&rdquo; in the Philippines; that
moreover he was employed by Father Blancas in getting out divers
hand-books of devotion for the Indians, as well as for the missionaries
themselves; and that as the said Juan was a good worker, always busy at
his trade, he printed very many books, among them a <i>Memorial of the
Christian life</i>; book on the <i lang=
"es">postrimerias</i>&mdash;that is, the Four Great Last
Truths&mdash;Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell; <i>Preparation for
Communion</i>; <i>Confession-Book</i>; the <i>Mysteries of the
Rosary</i>; an <i lang="es">Arte</i> for the Tagals, or Aid to learn
Spanish, and the like. Such are the titles of some of the books printed
at Binondo by Juan de Vera.</p>
<p>Commenting on the above statements of Aduarte, our bibliographer,
however, makes this very sensible observation,&mdash;the omission,
namely, of any positive information on two points of utmost importance
to the antiquary and historian,&mdash;at what time, that is, was de
Vera&rsquo;s press set up in the Philippines; and whence was it brought
to those islands? Anent the first press it is noteworthy (according to
the unanimous opinion of critics) that it certainly was not carried
thither from Spain, though maybe sent over from Mexico, where printing
was established in the early years of the sixteenth century, Retana,
however, maintaining as likelier that the first printing-outfit
introduced into the Philippines was brought thither from Japan, where
(as we otherwise know) a book, the <i lang="es">Sanctos no
Gosagueo</i>, or Compendium of the Lives of the Saints, was printed at
the Jesuit College at Katsusa, in 1591. In the same kingdom I find
printed (at another Jesuit College) at &ldquo;Nangasaki,&rdquo; in
1603, the <i lang="es">Vocabulario de Jap&oacute;n</i>, Japanese
ancestor of the old Bugar&iacute;n dictionary elsewhere referred to (in
this paper) as having been published at Manila in 1630.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1335src" href="#xd20e1335" name="xd20e1335src">9</a>
In Japan,&mdash;the fact is worth noting,&mdash;ten different works
were printed in Roman characters prior to the year 1599.</p>
<p>But let us return to Luzon. If Aduarte is right in his assertion
that Juan de Vera was &ldquo;the first printer in the
Philippines,&rdquo; then the press was at work prior to the year 1610,
and the Tagal <i lang="es">Arte</i> (just described) is not the
forerunner of Philippine imprints. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>So much for one of Retana&rsquo;s oracles. Now pass we on to
consider the second and only other writer that, with original sources
at hand, has treated of this bibliographical problem, Father
Mart&iacute;nez-Vigil, who, in the story of his order (named ahead)
mentions this fact, that when resident at Manila he was shown a very
rich codex&mdash;a MS.&mdash;of over six hundred folios, on Chinese
paper, in perfect condition, for many reasons (all duly set forth) of
unassailable authenticity, and albeit (he remarks) somewhat hard to
decipher, except to a pal&aelig;ontologist, yet written with marvelous
clearness and neatness of penmanship. In this MS., which (the Father
says) was written during the years 1609&ndash;1610, besides an account
of all notable occurrences in the islands from 1581 to 1606, with which
latter year the story ends, four years earlier, you should observe,
than Pinpin&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Arte</i> of 1610, are also to be read
these words: &ldquo;<span lang="es">Los que primero imprimieron fueron
del &oacute;rden de San Agust&iacute;n el P. Fr. Juan de Villanueva,
algunos tratadillos; mas del &oacute;rden de Sto. Domingo el P. Fr.
Francisco de San Joseph cosas mayores y de mas tomo el primero que
escribi&oacute; en lengua araya fu&eacute; de la
Compa&ntilde;ia.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereof, the meaning substantially is, that &ldquo;the first
printers (in the Philippines) were of the Order of St. Augustine, among
them Father Juan de Villanueva, publisher of some small
treatises&mdash;<i lang="es">tratadillos</i>; then others of the Order
of St. Dominic, of whom Father Francisco de San Joseph printed works of
larger bulk, and was the first of his brethren to write in <i>araya</i>
(Tagal?).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here then, in these quotations from two Dominican
monuments&mdash;Aduarte&rsquo;s history and the MS. (quoted by
Mart&iacute;nez-Vigil), the latter ending with events of the year
1606&mdash;you have all that antiquity tells of the introduction of the
printing-press into the Philippines.</p>
<p>To the assertion (in the MS.), relative to the Augustinian press,
may be appended an item or so in regard to the art-establishment of
that order at Lubao, in Pampanga province in Luzon, which I have picked
up from one of their chroniclers, Gaspar de San Agust&iacute;n, a Tagal
and Visaya linguist, who died, some say at Tondo, others at Manila, in
1724, after nearly fifty years&rsquo; mission-service in the islands.
In his history (Madrid, 1698), are the following words in reference to
Lubao convent: &ldquo;<span lang="es">Se han celebrado en este Convento
algunos Capitulos intermedios y mucho tiempo huvo Estudios menores de
Gramatica y Retorica; y teniamos tambien en &eacute;l una muy buena
Imprenta, traida <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>del Jap&oacute;n, en que se imprimian muchos
libros, assi en la lengua Espa&ntilde;ola como Pampanga y
Tagala.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1377src" href=
"#xd20e1377" name="xd20e1377src">10</a></p>
<p>In brief, that is, Father Gaspar says that &ldquo;in Lubao convent,
where the order maintained a school of grammar and rhetoric, there was
a press (brought from Japan), whereon many books were printed in
Spanish, Pampanga, and Tagal.&rdquo; May we not, then, be justified in
surmising that this Lubao press was the one referred to in the MS.
adduced by Mart&iacute;nez-Vigil, that attributes to Augustinians the
introduction of typography into the Philippines? And, moreover, since
the said ancient MS. ends with the year 1606, that this Lubao press was
at work at a still earlier date?</p>
<p>But, enough. With no originals at hand, we feel disinclined to
pursue this topic further as to the priority of printing in the
islands, nor do we care to press the question, whether, namely, the
first book of Philippine manufacture was Bugar&iacute;n&rsquo;s
dictionary of 1630, Blancas&rsquo; <i lang="es">Arte</i> of 1610, or
the Lubao <i lang="es">tratadillos</i> of 1606.</p>
<p>In our own colonies (we may observe) printing was introduced, first
at Cambridge in Massachusetts, in 1638; while in Pennsylvania the first
book printed&mdash;an almanac&mdash;by William Bradford, of
Philadelphia, is dated 1685, a full half century later, that is, than
the introduction of this &ldquo;art preservative of arts&rdquo; into
Malaysia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
